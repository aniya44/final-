        <h2>SUNY Cortland Cheerleading</h2>
        <h3>NCA DIII All Girl </h3>
        <p> <br>
            SUNY Cortland Cheerleading is a competitive club sport at SUNY Cortland. We participate in school events like pep rallies, football games, and Cortaca. We also compete at NCA Collegiate Nationals in Daytona Beach, Florida. As a club sport we don't receive any school funding, so we fundraise all of our expenses throughout the year. Some fundraising events we host on campus are pie a cheerleader and our college prep clinic. Our job as a team is to support the football team and hype up the crowd at home games and Cortaca. Our main goal as a team is to prepare as much as possible to compete against other talented athletes at Nationals. Most importantly, our responsibility as Cortland cheerleaders is to represent the school in a positive way! We do this by showing good sportsmanship, acting as role models in our community, putting education first, and showing off what Red Dragon Pride is really about!  <br>
